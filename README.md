# terraform-examples

This repository serves as a sample collection of Terraform examples for demonstrating integration with Digital.ai Release. It includes two distinct examples, one for AWS and another for Azure.


## AWS Exmaple

The AWS example is designed to provision an EC2 instance within a specified region, as configured in the main.tf file. To use this example, update the necessary parameters and execute Terraform commands to create the infrastructure in Digital.ai Release.

## Azure Example
The Azure example demonstrates the configuration for setting up a resource within a specific location, as defined in the main.tf file. 

## Note

Feel free to explore, modify, and extend these examples to suit your specific use cases. If you encounter any issues or have questions, refer to the official Terraform documentation or reach out for assistance.
